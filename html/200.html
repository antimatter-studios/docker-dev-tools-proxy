        <h3>Why are you seeing this page?</h3>
        <p> This software, Docker Proxy, works in tandem with the Docker Config Gen software
            which it uses to securely generate the '/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf' file by providing
            Docker Config Gen with a template, which is used to generate the final configuration file.
        </p>
        <p> This page is displayed when no configuration is being generated. So this is a default landing page</p>

        <h3>Does Docker Proxy require Docker Config Gen to run?</h3>
        <p> <b>YES</b>, it is absolutely required. The reason for this is for security. Docker Proxy cannot securely access the docker socket
            which would otherwise be required if you wanted to do this whole system in one container. Therefore Docker Config Gen is a 
            software that listens to docker events and looks for containers like Docker Proxy using the container labels, then using 
            some 'docker exec' calls between the two requests the template, gets all the containers, renders the template, then sends 
            it back to Docker Proxy which then reloads itself
        </p>
        <p> <b>TL;DR</b>: Download Docker Config Gen and run it side by side Docker Proxy, you can get it here: 
            <a href="https://github.com/antimatter-studios/docker-config-gen">https://github.com/antimatter-studios/docker-config-gen</a>
        </p>
        <p> If you decide to run Docker Dev Tools, then the 'ddt proxy' command will automatically run both of them side by side</p>
        
        <h3>How does Docker Proxy work?</h3>
        <p> Docker Proxy does not work alone, in order to securely listen to docker events, a software called Docker Config Gen is used
            to listen to the docker socket and listen for containers starting and stopping.
        </p>
        <p> A second basic part of setting up the proxy is that the proxy has to be on the same networks as the containers you want it to manage. 
            An example would be adding an NGINX container to host a website, either with a php backend of not. The NGINX container needs to be on
            the same network as the Docker Proxy. A good default pattern would be to create a docker network 'public' and add Docker Proxy to it. 
            Then all the public containers that need to be managed by Docker Proxy should be also on that network too. 
        </p>
        <pre>
            $ docker network create public 
            
            $ docker network ls
            NETWORK ID     NAME                        DRIVER    SCOPE
            8228fc81520d   bridge                      bridge    local
            fb064ba19e35   host                        host      local
            6e927ade98b6   none                        null      local
            ac3c37709a68   public                      bridge    local

            $ docker network connect public docker-proxy

            # This will output all the networks as in a simple manner
            $ docker container inspect docker-proxy -f '{{range $r,$v := .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{printf "%s\n" $r}}{{end}}'
            public
        </pre>
        <p> Docker Proxy cannot automatically create the 'public' network mentioned because it has to be a global network and it's not safe to 
            automatically create it as it might not be what the user wants. So it is a better idea to create this manually.
        </p>
        <p> Docker Dev Tools for example, lets you manage networks and it will create them, but this is another software that provides that additional
            functionality because that is the use pattern for that software. But Docker Proxy is trying to not demand to work in a particular way
            but allow itself to be used in whatever way the user would like.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I configure containers to use with this proxy?</h3>
        <p> In order to automatically configure and route requests to upstream containers, those containers need to add docker labels, or add environment
            variables so Docker Config Gen can process them into the template. The safest way to add those values is to use docker container labels. The 
            software originally was a fork of 'nginx-proxy' which is a very popular software that you can find here: <a href="https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy">https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy</a>
        </p>
        <h4> Configuring using docker labels <b>(Recommended)</b> inside a docker-compose.yml might be:</h4>
        <pre class="allow-format">
version: "3"
services:
    website:
        build: .
        networks:
            - public
        labels:
            - docker-proxy.main.host=~api.mycompany.develop$$
            - docker-proxy.main.port=5000
            - docker-proxy.main.path=^/api-endpoint
            - docker-proxy.main.proto=http
        </pre>
        <p> The only required docker label is the host field, as all the others will default to port 80, path '/', and proto http</p>
        <p> As expected, host and path support regex using normal NGINX configuration styles. Please look those up if it is unclear.</p>
        <p> The benefit of using docker labels is that this information is privately communicated with Docker Config Gen and does not expose
            environment variables or potentially secret data. A second benefit is that you can expose multiple upstreams because the 
            docker label key format is "docker-proxy.{UPSTREAM_NAME}.[host,port,path,proto]"
        </p>
        <p> It might be that a software being run exposes multiple ports or multiple paths, for example a control panel in addition 
            to a public endpoint for actions. Therefore it might be useful to expose both the control panel and the public endpoint 
            so both can be accessed. In order to configure two independent upstreams, two configurations would be required 
            (this is why labels make it easier than environment vars). An example could be:
        </p>
        <pre class="allow-format">
version: "3"
services:
    website:
        build: .
        networks:
            - public
        labels:
            - docker-proxy.control-panel.host=~api.mycompany.develop$$
            - docker-proxy.control-panel.port=80
            - docker-proxy.control-panel.path=^/admin
            - docker-proxy.api.host=~api.mycompany.develop$$
            - docker-proxy.api.port=5000
            - docker-proxy.api.path=^/api
        </pre>
        <p> This would let both upstreams be available and as many as required can be created</p>

        <h4> Configuring using Environment Variables <b>(Not recommended)</b>:</h4>
        <pre>
            # Environment variables
            VIRTUAL_HOST=~api.mycompany.develop
            VIRTUAL_PORT=5000
            VIRTUAL_PATH=^/api-endpoint
            VIRTUAL_PROTO=http
        </pre>
        <p> The only required environment variable is 'VIRTUAL_HOST' as all the others will default to port 80, path '/', and proto http.</p>
        <p> VIRTUAL_HOST and VIRTUAL_PATH support regex using normal NGINX configuration styles. Please look those up if it is unclear.
        </p>
        <p> The problem with environment variables is that these pieces of data will be injected into the environment of the container itself
            meaning that potentially sensitive data is leaked into the environment of the software being run. This information is not useful to
            the software, so why expose this information to the software in the first place? It could be considered secret. Therefore that is the reason
            why using environment variables is not recommended
        </p>
        <p> A second problem with environment variables, is that only one configuration per container can be created. Why would this matter? Because 
            if the software had multiple ports or paths exposed, only one of those would be usable at a time, since you cannot configure an environment
            variable that is understandable in a reasonable way as an array. Maybe with CSV like values. But this is too complex and error prone.
        </p>
        
        <h3> What is Docker Config Gen?</h3>
        <p> Docker Config Gen is a software which runs alongside Docker Proxy and is looking for one thing, containers that have the following labels:</p>
        <pre>
            - docker-config-gen.request=/app/scripts/request.sh
            - docker-config-gen.response=/app/scripts/response.sh
            - docker-config-gen.renderer=nginx
        </pre>
        <p> These labels tell Docker Config Gen how to request the template to render, how to send back the template, and what template renderer to use when doing so. 
        </p>
        <p> Docker Proxy has these labels configured already. Docker Config Gen will find Docker Proxy with these labels, then determine what docker networks it 
            is present on, then list all containers on each of those networks. 
        </p>
        <p> Once Docker Config Gen knows the list of containers on each network that Docker Proxy is on, it'll pass that container list to a template renderer given
            using the above 'renderer' label and a new template will be renderer according to the EJS formatted template Docker Proxy gives when the 'request' script 
            is executed. After the template is rendered, the 'response' script will be triggered with the template and Docker Proxy will write a new configuration, then
            reload nginx to make that configuration active.
        </p>
        <p> The Docker Config Gen is available here for more information: <a href="https://github.com/antimatter-studios/docker-config-gen">https://github.com/antimatter-studios/docker-config-gen</a></p>

        <h3>What is Docker Dev Tools?</h3>
        <p> It was mentioned a few times above a software called 'Docker Dev Tools'. So an explanation is warranted</p>
        <p> This is a software which provides some easy tools in order to manage your local development environment by running some command line utilities
            that will make doing things like setting up a safe local ip address, running the Docker Proxy, managing project orchestration etc without having
            to run complex commands. Examples would be:
        </p>
        <h4>Software like XDebug needs to call back to the host machine to communicate with the debugger, so a stable ip address is useful</h4>
        <pre>$ ddt ip add 127.0.0.254</pre>
